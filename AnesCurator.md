### Resources 
Reddit[1][1]

#### 1. [Stanford CA1 guide](http://ether.stanford.edu/ca1_new/)
* especially with all of the free time you're likely to have in the next few months, it's probably worth slogging through right now. It's also a good reference throughout the year
* easy to read and finish
* hits high yield topics

#### 2. QBanks
* TrueLearn is gold standard for ITE and BASIC; I have seen or used M5, Ultimate Board Prep, Anesthesia Toolbox, and BoardVitals (do not use BoardVitals--many of the questions are old, outdated, or flat out incorrect), and have found them to be inferior to TrueLearn, but YMMV.

#### 3. Textbooks
* you could honestly do almost all of anesthesia residency with just TrueLearn and Baby Miller, but if you only bought one textbook Big Miller is all you need. A lot of programs (mine included) use Morgan and Mikhail, but it's just a badly translated, poorly distilled Big Miller. The other big names are Stoelting's Anesthesia and Coexisting Disease, Chestnut's Obstetric Anesthesia, and Smith's Anesthesia for Infants and Children.
* Procedure reference: I highly recommend Jaffe's Anesthesiologist's Manual of Surgical Procedures especially as a CA1. It gives you a starting point in terms of formulating a plan and some reasonable expectation about the progression of the surgeries you're in.

I also carried two resources in the OR pretty much every day of CA1/2:
#### 4. Pocket Anesthesia
* it's a cheap, relatively comprehensive quick reference when an attending pimps you and you don't know the answer.

#### 5. Anesthesia Reference Sheets
* specifically the anesthesia and critical care sheet. Similar to Pocket Anesthesia; less comprehensive, but lighter, fits in a pocket, and has some good quick hitters like common anesthetic drugs and their dosages, MH protocol, pressors, etc. Back side has ACLS/PALS and a butt-ton of formulas.

## Tips
Refs[2][2]
### Studying
In terms of studying resources I recommend the following in order:
* Stanford Ether CA1 Guide
** easy to read and finish
** hits high yield topics
* Duke's Anesthesia Secrets
** Easy to read
** Can look at specific chapters (ie opioids, paralytics etc)
** Provides a little bit more info in depth
** Some info is a touch outdated but nice to build a solid knowledge base
** General chapters* from any of the 'big resources' (ie Baby Miller, M&M, Barash etc) ie Pharmacology, Airway, Machine etc are high yield
** You can read about specialty topics later
** If you are eager/have time you can look at a general population you may come see often (ie obese, elderly, ESRD, COPD etc)
* OpenAnesthesia
** Use this to look up keywords during a case
* ITE/ABA Basic Exam Prep
** University of Kentucky Anesthesiology Keyword Review (there is one for 2016 and 2017)
** Easy to listen to while commuting
* TrueLearn
** This is the UW of anesthesia.
** Very high yield.
** More than enough to kill it.
* General tips
** The people who didn't do well either 1) didn't study at all or 2) tried to study hardcore a month before
** The people who did well 1) did a tiny tiny tiny bit of studying each day enough time beforehand 2) paid attention during cases
** Meaning they let the patient/surgery teach them something. For example, for an obese patient one could look up how obesity changes important topics in anesthesia (FRC, dosing, digestion, nerve injury etc). I think by reading quickly the things above will clue one in to the important concepts during a case. And then during a case those concepts will be reinforced. And finally you’ll see how they are tested when you do TrueLearn.

### Take care of yourself
60 hours on the floors =/= 60 hours on the stool. Vigilance will make you feel tired on Friday. It will hit you really hard at like 6pm. When you hear that desat you will feel dread. You already know that burnout, chemical dependency and mental health issues are common throughout medicine. Find something to take your mind off things. Laugh a bit.
* OR Case Cancelled due to No Timeouts Remaining
* Anesthesia Blamed for Taking Blame for Everything

### You are NOT alone
Anesthesia is practiced in a silo. You don’t know if you’re the best resident in your class or the worst. Just accept this. If you read a little bit, pay attention during the cases and listen to your attending you’re moving in the right direction. Heck some days you’ll have barely enough energy to do just one - and that’s fine!

### You’ll have bad days - everyone has them!
* Some days you won’t get an IV/airway/a-line/central line to save your life. It happens. It just stinks because maybe that is the only impression the attending has of you. If they don’t realize you’re a CA1 and the learning curve is steep then just f them. Other residents + understanding attendings get this.

### Utilize Evernote and SimpleNote
* Write down the type of case. And when you pre-op with Jaffe’s Manual and the 5 Minute Consult you can type in what you learned. Make it very short. The goal is that next time you have this case you can look up what you did last time. That’ll save you tons of time pre-opping. And throughout the case and year you can add more details. Like maybe what the surgeon didn’t want or what your attending preferred.

### How to be a ‘good’ resident
* Be ready to roll back on time
* Ask your attending before giving blood or when EBL gets > 500
* Keep your space super super neat and tidy
* Throw away wrappers
* Have labels facing up
* Line caps up
* Put stylet/blade away from workspace
* Fold the towel neatly
* Label the lines (ie 18 G R hand)
* Have nothing touch the floor (a bit extreme I do admit)
* Like no lines, cords on the floor
* A-I-M
* From top to bottom: airway - IV- monitors
* Come back early from your breaks
* Show up to your weekend call shift 10 minutes early
* Offer to push the bed back yourself
* Clean up after you place an IV
* Remember people’s names in the OR (write them down if you can’t remember)
* Realize there is only one way right way to do anesthesia - your attendings way! (kidding) (That means your attending knows a lot more than you so mimic their preferences - how they tape the tube, how they dose the prop, where they put the blade after using it etc)
* Be calm (like when intubating imagine you are going slow mo - that’ll make you look more confident)
* Be knowledgeable -> Doesn’t matter if Martha Stewart herself tidied up everything. Tidiness only carries you so far for so long. Read/listen to the above and you’ll be on your way my friend :)
